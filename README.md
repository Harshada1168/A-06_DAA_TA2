Implementing Dictionary using Optimal Binary Search Tree 

In this program a dictionary has been created using concept of optimal binary search tree in which an input text file has been provided for creating OBST as words are acting as nodes of the tree. The cost of the tree is also calculated after the tree has ben created. The words in the OBST are sorted according to the lexicographical order and hence multiple levels are formed in the tree. 
This program also provides functionality to th user to search for a specific word in the tree, if user enters a word which is present in the tree it gives the message that the word is present in the tree and also returns the level in the tree where the word is located and if the word is not present in the tree it gives the message that the word is not present in the tree.This is one of the applications of the Optimal Binary Search Tree.
